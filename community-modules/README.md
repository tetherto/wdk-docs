# Community Modules

This section lists wallet and protocol modules created by the community. 

- These modules are **not official** and **not maintained by the WDK or Tether team**.
- They are built and supported by the community to help others add new features or connect to more ecosystems.

## Why Community Modules?

- Share modules that solve specific problems
- Connect your wallet to more ecosystems
- Learn from code made by other users

## Listing a Module

To add your module here:
1. Make sure your code is public and has a simple README.
2. Open an issue or pull request to suggest your module be listed.
3. Include: name, short description, maintainer/contact, and link to repository.

The WDK team will review and add new modules at their discretion.
