# Install WDK Core

This guide shows you how to install the `@tetherto/wdk` package, which serves as the main entry point for the Wallet Development Kit (WDK).

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed:

*   **Node.js**: version 18 or higher.
*   **npm**: usually comes with Node.js.

## Installation

To install the WDK Core package, run the following command in your terminal:

```bash
npm install @tetherto/wdk
```

This package allows you to manage different blockchain wallets and protocols through a single interface.

## Next steps

Now that you have installed the core package, you can [instantiate the WDK](./instantiation.md) to start creating wallets.
