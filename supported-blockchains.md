## How to Add a New Blockchain
1. Add a new config object for your blockchain:
   ```js
   const config = {
     ...,
     mychain: {
       chainId: 123,
       blockchain: "mychain",
       rpcUrl: "https://rpc.mychain.org",
       // ...other fields
     }
   };
   ```
2. Pass it to `WdkManager` during initialization.
3. Use the unified API as with any other chain.

For usage and integration, see the [API Reference](api-reference.md).
