## üõ†Ô∏è How it Works
WDK acts as a thin, stateless abstraction layer between your app and multiple blockchains. You provide the configuration and secrets; WDK provides a unified API for all wallet operations.

```
[Your App] ‚Üí [WDK] ‚Üí [Ethereum | Bitcoin | TON | Spark]
```

- No data is ever stored by WDK.
- All sensitive operations are performed in-memory.
- You decide how to manage keys, sessions, and storage.
