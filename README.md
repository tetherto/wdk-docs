## 🚀 What is WDK?
WDK provides a unified, stateless, and non-custodial interface for wallet applications, abstracting away blockchain complexity while ensuring users retain full control of their assets. Whether you're building for Ethereum, Bitcoin, TON, or the Lightning Network, WDK empowers you to deliver seamless multi-chain experiences.

## 🛠️ How it Works
WDK acts as a thin, stateless abstraction layer between your app and multiple blockchains. You provide the configuration and secrets; WDK provides a unified API for all wallet operations.

```
[Your App] → [WDK] → [Ethereum | Bitcoin | TON | Spark]
```

- No data is ever stored by WDK.
- All sensitive operations are performed in-memory.
- You decide how to manage keys, sessions, and storage.
