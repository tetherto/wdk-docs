# Wallet Development Kit (WDK)

**Tether‚Äôs open-source Wallet Development Kit (WDK)** empowers developers to build secure, non-custodial wallets with unified blockchain access, stateless architecture, and complete user control. WDK simplifies the complexity of blockchain infrastructure without compromising on flexibility or security.

---

## What is WDK?

WDK is a **developer-first framework** to create cross-chain wallets that are secure, extensible, and production-ready. It provides a single, stateless API to interact with Ethereum, Bitcoin, TON, and Spark (Lightning Network)‚Äîabstracting blockchain-specific complexity while keeping developers in full control of keys and data.

---

## üîë Key Features

- **Multi-Blockchain Support**: Ethereum, Polygon, Arbitrum, Bitcoin, TON, Spark
- **Unified API Layer**: A single interface across chains
- **Account Abstraction**: Enable gasless transactions & custom fee logic on EVM & TON
- **Stateless & Secure**: No secrets or data are stored by WDK
- **Non-Custodial by Design**: You manage keys; WDK never sees them
- **DeFi Ready**: Built-in support for swaps, token transfers, and cross-chain actions
- **Modular & Extensible**: Add your own chains, tokens, or business logic

---

## üë§ Who is WDK for?

### Developers & Builders
- Create mobile/web wallets in minutes using a familiar JS/TS interface
- Integrate advanced features like account abstraction without reinventing the wheel

### Startups & Enterprises
- Launch wallet products with full ownership of UX, logic, and keys
- Customize flows like tipping, swapping, buying/selling, and more

### Educators & Innovators
- Use WDK to prototype, test, and teach wallet development across major blockchains

---

## üîç How It Works

WDK is **stateless**: it processes requests but stores nothing. All sensitive data (keys, sessions, configs) stays in your hands.

```

[Your App] ‚Üí [WDK API] ‚Üí [Ethereum | Bitcoin | TON | Spark]

```

This guarantees:
- No custodial risk
- Full user control
- Flexibility to scale or pivot

---

## üõ†Ô∏è Use Cases

- Build wallets for creators, communities, or DAOs
- Integrate wallet functions into DeFi, payments, gaming, or tipping apps
- Develop cross-platform wallet experiences (React Native, Electron, Web)

---

## üåç Supported Blockchains

WDK supports a growing set of blockchains. This list is continuously expanding, with **more integrations coming soon**. Chains marked with ‚è≥ are in active development.

## üîê Completely non custodial

WDK never stores or transmits secrets. Developers are responsible for key storage using secure techniques like OS keychain, HSMs, or hardware wallets. All operations are performed in-memory.
